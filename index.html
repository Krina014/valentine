            <h3>
    As you know, Today is Valentine's day. 
    I know you believe that every moment is special when we're with eachother                    
    And I also believe this
    BUT...
        I think we should celebrate it just to not miss a chance to make your partner feel special      

        So this is for you because you're the most important person to me... 

            I want you in my whole life...
            I want to see your face first when i wake up...
            I want to cook with you...
            I want to have all meals with you...
            I want to get ready for office with you...
            I want to travel whole world with you...
            I want to grow my family with you...
            I want to enjoy each and every moment with you...
            I want to smile with you...
